# binary-audio-classification
Neural Network that solves audio binary classification problem predicting whether the speaker on audio is male or female \n
It was created to solve a problem from Young Con selection test. After 15-20 epochs with the params in code, it had an accuracy of about 99% on closed test dataset, when using all training data for learning. \n 
AudioClassifier.py builds and trains a CNN on Mel-Spectrograms of audio files \n
